## Math
## Math operator
print ("5+2=", 5+2) #7
print ("5-2=", 5-2) #3
print ("5*2=", 5*2) #10
print ("5/2=", 5/2) #2.5
print ("5%2=", 5%2) #1
print ("5**2=", 5**2) #25
print ("5//2=", 5//2) #2 , 5 devide by 2 and through out the reminder which is 1
print ("1+2-3*2=", 1+2-3*2) # -3
print ("(1+2-3)*2=", 1(+2-3)*2) # -3

## Built in functions
print (int(1.5)) #round down to nearest integer = 1
print (float(2)) #2.0
print (abs(5)) # how many units from 0 , will give 5 if -5 it will still give 5
print (max(1,2)) #it will show which number is bigger
print (min(1,2)) #will give smaller number
print (pow(3,2)) #three to power of 2 will be 9
